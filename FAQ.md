# Frequently Asked Questions

## Can I use this software to provide commercial SaaS services?

You may **NOT** use this software to operate a commercial Software-as-a-Service offering without either:
1. Releasing your modified source code under AGPL-3.0, including making it available to all users of your service
2. Obtaining explicit written permission from the copyright holder

The GNU AGPL-3.0 requires that any modified versions must be released under the same license if made available to users over a network. This means SaaS operators must either:
- Make their entire modified codebase publicly available
- Negotiate a separate licensing agreement with the copyright holder
